        "abstract": "With the development of robotic technology, smart home system becomes more and more popular in metropolitan area. Among all kinds of household devices, cleaning robot has been researched for many years and become a necessary element in smart home system. So far, Commercial cleaning robots for household usage have been available on the market for decades. However, there are still some critical problems remained to be solved, especially the navigation problem. Empirical statistics have revealed that most commercial floor clearing robots don't have a high cleaning efficiency. This phenomenon mainly reflects in two aspects. Firstly, most cleaning robots don't have an efficient mechanism to record its own trajectory. As a result, many cleaning robots clean a certain areas repetitively, which wastes time and lows efficiency. Secondly, most cleaning robot can't perceive the surrounding accurately, so they have problems in obstacle avoidance and route planning. To address the mentioned problem, a novel navigation system for indoor cleaning robot is proposed in this paper. Localization algorithm, stereoscopic vision, wireless network, and human-machine interaction are integrated to promote the working performance of cleaning robot.",

        "abstract": "Robotics technology has been constantly developing during the past two decades. Over recent years, several researches have been conducted to develop climbing robots to eliminate humans from laborious and dangerous tasks. Cleaning of walls of tall buildings is one of the applications of the climbing robot. The wall cleaning robot proposed in this paper consists of base module and cleaning module. We are using an electric ducted fan (EDF) and support ropes from base module placed on the parapet for adhering the cleaning module to the glass wall. This robot is designed in such a way that the cleaning module alone can also be used to clean the floor in which the EDF acts as a vacuum cleaner along with a vacuum pump to spray the cleaning fluid. Hence both dry and wet cleaning of floor can be done. The floor cleaning system is manually controlled using bluetooth signal from a smart phone, while wall cleaning is carried out automatically using sensors.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an end-to-end method for training convolutional neural networks for autonomous navigation of a mobile robot. Traditional approach for robot navigation consists of three steps. The first step is extracting visual features from the scene using the camera input. The second step is to figure out the current position by using a classifier on the extracted visual features. The last step is making a rule for moving the direction manually or training a model to handle the direction. In contrast to the traditional multi-step method, the proposed visuo-motor navigation system can directly output the linear and angular velocities of the robot from an input image in a single step. The trained model gives wheel velocities for navigation as outputs in real-time making it possible to be implanted on mobile robots such as robotic vacuum cleaner. The experimental results show an average linear velocity error of 2.2 cm/s and average angular velocity error of 3.03 degree/s. The robot deployed with the proposed model can navigate in a real-world environment by only using the camera without relying on any other sensors such as LiDAR, Radar, IR, GPS, IMU.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a general problem of sensory navigation for autonomous cleaning robots (ACR) in unknown environments. Although absolute self-localization and accurate environment modeling still remain unsolved, a delicately designed mobile robot still can carry out a task practically. Under this strategy, we propose a cleaning robot system, which works without any environment map and global self-localization. It has a three-layer structure. The lower layer is composed of general hardware: ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, incremental encoders, DC motors, vacuum, etc. Upon these sensors is the sensory behavior layer, which includes several motion templates. These intelligent motion templates can deal with most situations, seldom making the robot trapped. The upper layer is the task-based navigation layer, which carries out the tasks of environment learning, cleaning, and homing. Finally the experiment results show that this strategy works well, even if the robot knows only a little about the environment.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous and automatic home Mess-Cleanup Robot (Mcbot) is newly developed in this paper. So far, the vacuum-cleaner had made the burden of house chore lighten but the operational labor of a vacuum-cleaner had been so severe. Recently, the cleaning robot was commercialized to solve home cleaning labor problem but it also was not successful because it still had a problem of mess-cleanup, which was the clean-up of big trash and the arrangement of newspapers, clothes, etc. The cleaning robot just vacuum dust and so small trash but has no function to arrange the mess-up and throw away the big trash in house. For this reason, the market for the cleaning robot is not yet actively built up. So, we develop a new home mess-cleanup robot McBot to perfectly overcome this problem. It needs functions of agile navigation and novel manipulation system for mess-cleanup. The autonomous navigation system has to be controlled for the full scanning of living room and for the precise tracking of the desired path, It must be also able to recognize the absolute position and orientation of the self and to distinguish the mess object to clean-up from obstacle object to just avoid. The manipulator, which is not needed in the vacuum-cleaning robot, has the functions to distinguish big trash to clean from mess objects to arrange, to use its discretion in according to the form of mess objects and to properly carry them to the destination. We use the RFID system to sense them in this paper and propose the new disposition algorithm to have RFID tags installed on the floor and objects indoor. Then, it should be an intelligent system so that the messed-cleanup task can be autonomously performed in a wide variety of situations and environments. It needs to also have an intelligent interaction function for the human-friendly communication. Finally, the good performance of the developed McBot is confirmed through the results of the mess-cleanup experiments.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of Automation, Robots are seeing widespread use in Industrial manufacturing, Automated retail, Surveillance and Security. In the same breath, home automation has also evoked interest among different user groups. Currently, high-priced floor cleaning robots produced industrially are beyond the purchasing capability of normal households in third world countries. In this paper, we have introduced an initiative to build a cost-effective floor cleaner robot. Using a vacuum cleaning system, we designed and implemented a cleaning robot. The paper has described how an operational floor cleaning robot prototype has been developed along with the techniques of the indoor mapping and positioning system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega were used in unison as the processor of the robot. This robot can map and clean a certain area of a building floor autonomously. One novel contribution of this work is the introduction of a GPS module to the Raspberry Pi so that the robot can be aware of its location and move in the right direction. Human assistance is only required for waste disposal and maintenance. Our future goal is to add a reliable autonomous waste disposal feature in the prototype.",

        "abstract": "Cleaning the floor from dust is one of the routine activities carried out every day. This activity is not only at home but also in offices or shopping centers. Sometimes due to dust cleaning activities take a long time then there are other activities that are overlooked. For this reason, we are trying to develop a smart floor cleaning robot that can navigate, clean dust, and polish floors automatically. The study was conducted using Pressman's research and development methods which included the following phases: analysis, design, implementation and testing. The robot, developed using an omniwheel wheel and is equipped with a vacuum cleaner and floor polishing motor. The control system used is based on the Arduino microcontroller, the robot is also equipped with a Bluetooth communication system so that it can be controlled via an Android smartphone. The developed robot is able to move according to navigation controls via an android smartphone. Besides this robot is also able to move to avoid obstacles if the distance between the robot and the barrier is less than 15 cm. Floor cleaning performance on various types of dirt is quite good with only leaving dirt on the floor less than 20%.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, topics related to robotics have become one of the researching fields. In the meantime, intelligent mobile robots have great acceptance, but the control and navigation of these devices are very difficult, and the lack of dealing with fixed obstacles and avoiding them, due to safe and secure routing, is the basic requirement of these systems. In this paper, the modified artificial potential field (APF) method is proposed for that robot avoids collision with fixed obstacles and reaches the target in an optimal path; using this algorithm, the robot can run to the target in optimal environments without any problems by avoiding obstacles, and also using this algorithm, unlike the APF algorithm, the robot does not get stuck in the local minimum. We are looking for an appropriate cost function, with restrictions that we have, and the goal is to avoid obstacles, achieve the target, and do not stop the robot in local minimum. The previous method, APF algorithm, has advantages, such as the use of a simple math model, which is easy to understand and implement. However, this algorithm has many drawbacks; the major drawback of this problem is at the local minimum and the inaccessibility of the target when the obstacles are in the vicinity of the target. Therefore, in order to obtain a better result and to improve the shortcomings of the APF algorithm, this algorithm needs to be improved. Here, the obstacle avoidance planning algorithm is proposed based on the improvement of the artificial potential field algorithm to solve this local minimum problem. In the end, simulation results are evaluated using MATLAB software. The simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to the existing solution.",
